Caveats:
  1. The instructions specify that no external libraries can be used to solve the problem.
     I decided I wanted to use a regex to validate a Roman numeral. I could have written
     the regex myself. However, when splitting hairs a regex statement is not a library
     and since the best programmers are lazy and steal when ever possible I decided to
     steal the regex, with proper credit of course. Everything else was written by me.
  2. The problem description did not specify if the inputs should be case sensitive
     or case insensitive. In all the examples the resource names and the word 'Credits'
     all always capitalized. However since this is a coding exercise where I am not
     allowed to ask for clarification I decided to follow the pattern set by the examples
     and make the inputs case sensitive.
  3. Along the same vein, the question examples always have a space before the '?',
     following the same reasoning as the previous the space will be required.
  4. This problem leans more to a functional solution than an OOP solution, or that
     might be my impression since I am actively learning Elixir and I am seeing things
     through functional-tinted glasses.
